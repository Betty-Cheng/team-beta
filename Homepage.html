  Why Do young people become homeless?
</p>

<p>
  Young people who become homeless are depicted in the media in different ways.  Sometimes they are portrayed as coming from families and homes that are characterized by violence. Other times they are portrayed as young adventurers, who leave home to explore the world and seek out the bright lights of the big city.  Yet other times, they are seen as ‘rebellious’ teens who leave home for fairly frivolous reasons; as troublemakers tired of doing the dishes, who don’t want to stay in school or get a job, but rather want to experiment with the ‘bohemian’ lifestyle. From this perspective, the streets are seen to ‘pull’ young people towards excitement and freedom. As Karabanow has convincingly argued, however, the perspective that sees becoming homeless as a “choice” is inaccurate, and “has been denigrated by many researchers and service providers as insensitive, inaccurate, and lacking real understanding of the individual.”  (Karabanow, 2006).
While it may be true that some homeless youth leave home for fairly insignificant reasons, for most young people who become homeless, the reality is much different.  Those merely attracted to the "excitement” of life on the streets do not last long; the harsh reality of sexual and physical assault, hunger and sickness is usually enough to dissuade even the most adventurous of teenagers. Thus, this romanticized notion of street youth is inadequate.  This suggests the need to better understand what leads youth to the streets and what keeps them there.

The Causes of Youth Homelessness
</p>

<p>
Here are some common characteristics of young people experiencing homelessness:
</p>

<p>
1. Young people are homeless in urban and rural areas at the same rates.
2. Black and Latino youth experience homelessness at higher rates than other young people.
Roughly 40 percent of the total youth homeless population is LGBTQ. Compared to 7 percent of the general American youth population, LGBTQ youth are over-represented in the homeless population. They are 120 percent more likely to experience homelessness than their non-LGBTQ peers. And, more than one in four were thrown out of their homes.
Between one-quarter and one-third have been in foster care.
3. About half have been in juvenile detention, jail, or prison.
4. The highest risk factor for homeless youth is the lack of a high school diploma or GED. Without this basic level of education, they are 4.5 times more likely to experience homelessness.
Youth are physically and sexually abused at high rates (40-60% and 20-40% respectively).
5.  Roughly 47 percent of young people who are homeless were also part of families who experienced homelessness.
