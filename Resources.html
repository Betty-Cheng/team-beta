                <h3>Amber and Earl </h3>
            
                 <p> Amber and Earl are homeless living on the streets. Today they happened to be traveling through Denver, Colorado, which is where we met.

            Amber has been homeless for 4 years now, ever since the day she turned 18. Earl says his first taste of homelessness was at 16. But that he was “straight up” homeless by 17.
            
            Most of us walk by kids that look like Amber and Earl. But they are real people just like you and me. Most street kids were deprived of a normal family life. Most escape with drugs. The streets become home. It is very sad.

                <h3>Carol Ann </h3>
            
                 <p>In Portland, seeing young adults like Carol Ann is rather normal. On the outside many look happy, and the old hippie in me wants to believe they are happy. But the realist in me knows that most of our countries homeless youth are throwaways. 40 percent of homeless youth are never even reported missing. 

                    I am glad they found a strong community. Part of me wants to believe the fairytale life these kids present. I just can feel the pain behind the smiles, and I know most of these kids don't live in the "woods" by choice. 
                    
                    I have said this a few times. I wish someone would do research to find out how many street kids end up as chronic homeless in their adult lives.  
                    
                    Please, when you see kids like Carol Ann on the street, don't try and change them. Best thing to do is be a friend and listen. Years of pain and abuse don't go away quickly. Many have serious trust issues, and all of them can use more love </p>

             <h3>Rule </h3>
            
                 <p>Rule has been homeless since the age of 13. He is now 22. Rule has slept outside, in abandoned buildings, on couches, on trains, on buses, and hotel rooms. He says he has experienced every type of homelessness. 

                    It's no way for a kid to grow up. Rule says homeless youth get pushed into all sorts of things. He knows where he is going. He just doesn't know how to get there. Rule doesn't know when his homelessness will end. 
                    
                    Rule says homeless youth get acclimated to a life of homelessness. That over time, you get used to it. No one and especially no child or teenager should have to get used to homelessness. 
                    
                    From that National Network for Youth website https://www.nn4youth.org/learn/]: 
                    
                    The vast majority of youth do not become homeless by choice. Many different factors contribute to youth homelessness, but studies suggest that there are common paths to homelessness for young people. The majority of homeless youth have either run away, been kicked out of unstable home environments, abandoned by their families or caregivers, involved with public systems (foster care, juvenile justice, and mental health), or have a history of residential instability and disconnection.
                    
                    From new research by Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago on understanding and addressing youth homelessness [http://voicesofyouthcount.org/brief/n...]:
                    
                    1 in 10 young adults ages 18-25 experienced a form of homelessness over a 12-month period.
                    
                    That’s 3.5 million young adults. About half of them involved explicitly reported homelessness while the other half involved couch surfing only.
                    
                    1 in 30 youth ages 13-17 experienced a form of homelessness over a 12-month period.
                    
                    That’s about 700,000 youth. About three-quarters of them involved explicitly reported homelessness (including running away or being kicked out) and one-quarter involved couch surfing only. 
                    ""
                    If you've been following Invisible People you've probably heard me share that I often wonder how many homeless youths end up being homeless adults later in life. If we are ever going to end homelessness, we must look at all demographics of homelessness. Over the recent years, the sector has prioritized chronic homeless adults and we have gotten better at "closing the back door." Although I do support for various reasons getting the most vulnerable off the streets, in many ways we have left the front door wide open. 
                    
                    As we have seen these past few weeks how young adults can affect positive change in ways us adults are not able to, homeless youth need the same opportunities to grow up and make our world a better place.  We must make ending youth homelessness and family homelessness just has much of a priority as ending all homelessness!.</p>

                <h3>Terra</h3>
            
                 <p>I met Terra in Toronto, Canada. An outreach nurse who had been helping her connected us. Terra is a wonderful, gorgeous 25 year-old woman who has lived on the streets for 5 months. 

                    Terra tells a very real story about life on the streets. She doesn't like shelters because she was beat up in one, so she sleeps on the streets or in parks. 
                    
                    I hope Terra's story will stay in your heart and mind as it has with me. After this interview we took her to get some food. She is intelligent and funny, she just needs some extra love and compassion to change her life. The good news is the outreach nurse I was with is filled with that extra love and compassion and will do everything she can to find Terra some help. 
                    
                    Please support all health and medical outreach services in your community.
