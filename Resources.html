                <h3>Amber and Earl </h3>
            
                 <p> Amber and Earl are homeless living on the streets. Today they happened to be traveling through Denver, Colorado, which is where we met.

            Amber has been homeless for 4 years now, ever since the day she turned 18. Earl says his first taste of homelessness was at 16. But that he was “straight up” homeless by 17.
            
            Most of us walk by kids that look like Amber and Earl. But they are real people just like you and me. Most street kids were deprived of a normal family life. Most escape with drugs. The streets become home. It is very sad.
            
            watch this very informative video about human trafficking and homeless youth</p>

            <div>

                <h3>Carol Ann </h3>
            
                 <p>In Portland, seeing young adults like Carol Ann is rather normal. On the outside many look happy, and the old hippie in me wants to believe they are happy. But the realist in me knows that most of our countries homeless youth are throwaways. 40 percent of homeless youth are never even reported missing. 

                    I am glad they found a strong community. Part of me wants to believe the fairytale life these kids present. I just can feel the pain behind the smiles, and I know most of these kids don't live in the "woods" by choice. 
                    
                    I have said this a few times. I wish someone would do research to find out how many street kids end up as chronic homeless in their adult lives.  
                    
                    Please, when you see kids like Carol Ann on the street, don't try and change them. Best thing to do is be a friend and listen. Years of pain and abuse don't go away quickly. Many have serious trust issues, and all of them can use more love </p>

        <div class="storiestext Jon and Brenda">
            <div>

                <h3>Jon and Brenda </h3>
            
                 <p>I had just connected with a large group of "travelers" handing out Hanes socks before meeting Jon and Brenda. Travelers are a subculture of the homeless population often known for hopping trains. You’ve seen them hanging out in your city. They almost have a uniform wearing brown clothes and often have dogs and musical instruments.  Many are kids that have been "thrown away" by their families and find community traveling with others. 

                    I used to think no one wants to be homeless, and that is the truth for the vast majority of people sleeping outside. Even the ones who tell you that want to be homeless, at one time tried to get out of homelessness, but after hitting so many barriers, they just give up. It's called "learned helplessness." 
                    
                    But now, after meeting a few people like Jon and Brenda, I have changed.There are a few people that want to live a nomadic lifestyle. 
                    
                    Jon and Brenda are a married couple that travels by choice. They normally go up and down California, but this time, they decided to head east a little and visit Austin during SXSW. 
                    
                    They start by telling a story of joining up with a group of hippies.A fun moment is when we chat a little about what's the difference between a hippie and a traveler. You'll have to watch for the answer. 
                    
                    While passing through San Antonio, police picked them up and placed them in detox for smoking marijuana. That's insane!
                    
                    I love that their three wishes were so simple, but that's the traveling lifestyle. Jon and Brenda are great kids. I wish them safe travels on all of their journeys.</p>
