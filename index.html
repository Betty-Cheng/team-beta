                Each year, an estimated 4.2 million youth and young adults experience homelessness, of which 700,000
                are unaccompanied minors, meaning they are not part of a family or accompanied by a parent or
                guardian.
                On any given night, approximately 41,000 unaccompanied youth ages 13-25 experience homelessness.

                A Poor Nomad is a game about being a nomadic homeless youth and how dangerous it is to be one. You
                are Abby. She is a nomadic homeless youth and trying to get basic necessities such as food, water,
                shelter and money. The purpose of the game is to show you the harsh realities of being a homeless
                youth.

        <p>
            Why do so many young people leave their homes, even if it means becoming homeless? 
            <div class="div-space"></div>
            For many, home is unsafe and harmful. Youth are physically and sexually abused at high rates (40-60% and 20-40% respectively).
            <div class="div-space"></div>
            Their parents may have addictions to alcohol and/or drugs.
            In some cases, youth who experience homelessness were asked to leave home. These young people are sometimes called
            “throwaway youth,” a painful expression of what they may have experienced.
            <div class="div-space"></div>
            This typically occurs when parents disapprove of their behaviors (e.g., school problems, alcohol/drug use, or
            pregnancy) or lifestyle (e.g., sexual orientation). About half the time, becoming homeless as a young person is not
            their first experience of being without a home.
            <div class="div-space"></div>
            Roughly 47 percent of young people who are homeless were also part of families who experienced homelessness.While it may
            be true that some homeless youth leave home for fairly insignificant reasons, for most young people who become homeless,
            the reality is much different.
            <div class="div-space"></div>
            Those merely attracted to the "excitement” of life on the streets do not last long; the harsh reality of sexual and
            physical assault, hunger and sickness is usually enough to dissuade even the most adventurous of teenagers.
            <div class="div-space"></div>
            Thus, this romanticized notion of street youth is inadequate. This suggests the need to better understand what leads
            youth to the streets and what keeps them there.

            <p>Characteristics of Homeless Youth</p>
        </center> <br>
        <li> Young people are homeless in urban and rural areas at the same rates.</li>
        <li> Black and Latino youth experience homelessness at higher rates than other young people.</li>
        <li>Roughly 40 percent of the total youth homeless population is LGBTQ.
            Compared to 7 percent of the general American youth population, LGBTQ youth are over-represented in the
            homeless population.
            They are 120 percent more likely to experience homelessness than their non-LGBTQ peers.
            And, more than one in four were thrown out of their homes.</li>
        <li>Between one-quarter and one-third have been in foster care.</li>
        <li> About half have been in juvenile detention, jail, or prison.</li>
        <li> The highest risk factor for homeless youth is the lack of a high school diploma or GED.
            Without this basic level of education, they are 4.5 times more likely to experience homelessness.
        <li>Youth are physically and sexually abused at high rates (40-60% and 20-40% respectively).</li>
        <li> Roughly 47 percent of young people who are homeless were also part of families who experienced
            homelessness.</li>
