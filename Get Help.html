<p><br><br>Safe Place is a program that quickly connects runaway and homeless youth ages 12-17 to services, either by reuniting them with their family or providing them with emergency shelter. <br><br>The program is run by YouthCare and Friends of Youth in partnership with local businesses and non-profit organizations that have volunteered to be “Safe Places” across King County</p>

<div class="spacing"></div>
<div class="help2">
  <p><br>Safe Place is a national program that began in 1983 at the YMCA of Greater Louisville; since then, it has grown to include nearly 140 programs in forty states.</p>
<p><br> In King County, metro buses, local businesses, and non-profit organizations have volunteered to be “Safe Places”—locations where youth can go and request assistance.<br><br> Staff members at these locations are trained to respond to youth in need and immediately contact Safe Place.<br> There are currently over 2,100 Safe Place sites in King County.</p>
<p><br>Safe Place maintains a 24-hour hotline, 1-800 422 TEEN (8336), where youth can directly connect with Safe Place staff.<br>Within forty-five minutes, a Safe Place coordinator meets with the youth, assesses the situation, and works with the youth to place them at a shelter or reunite with parents/guardians.</p>
